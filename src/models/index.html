    This page serves as the source of truth for what is being shipped to what channel for
    Firefox translation models. Models are added to Nightly as they are trained. If they
    meet our acceptance criteria of being with ~5% of Google Translate's COMET scores then
    they are ready to ship. Some models may be held back or shipped at our teams discretion
    based on other evaluation metrics.
